# 📄 Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)

This folder contains the different versions of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents used throughout the Guru99 Bank Web App testing project.

## 📌 Purpose

The SRS documents were the foundation for planning and designing all test activities in this project — including test cases, system test plans, and bug reports.

## 📁 Versions Included

- `SRS_V1.pdf` – Initial version used for the first round of test cases
- `SRS_V2.pdf` – Updated version with new features and changes
- `SRS_V3.pdf` – Adjustments and minor UI/logic updates
- `SRS_V4.pdf` – Final version used for bug tracking and final test revisions

## ✅ How It Was Used

Each version influenced the test coverage and documentation:
- Test cases were updated based on evolving requirements
- Bugs were logged in relation to actual mismatches with the SRS
- The System Test Plan for the Manager Module was aligned with the latest SRS version
